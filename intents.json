          "VITEEE, like other competitive exams, requires proper strategy combined with excellent accuracy and speed. Although there is no negative marking like in other competitive examinations, you still need to have clear concepts and develop effective time-management strategies. Some preparation strategies that you can create are: \n1. Time Management: For VITEEE exam, it is not necessary to solve all questions, but it is about solving decent number of questions in a proper time frame. If you are not able to solve any question, then please do not waste your time on it and move on to the next one. Also, it is advisable to attempt the easy questions first and gradually move towards attempting the difficult ones. \n2. Develop Speed & Accuracy: Try to develop your own strategies to crack the exam. Enhance your analytical skills and aim to attempt all the questions while practicing. This will give you an edge over the other students. \n3. Have Clear Concepts: Try to clear all your confusion on time, as it is important for you to have a strong foundation to solve all levels of questions. The more you practice, the easier it becomes for you to fine-tune your concepts. Apart from solving old VITEEE papers, you can also solve the NCERT books for classes 11 and 12. \n4. Prepare Notes: It is advisable to prepare notes on the tips that you receive for the VITEEE exam. This will help you a lot during last minute revision, and the information might be handy for you, as you don’t have to look through your books again and again. \n5. Revision: Guess this is self-explanatory. You need to keep revising every few days to ensure the subject matter gets stored in your memory permanently."
